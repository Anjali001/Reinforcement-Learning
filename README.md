# Reinforcement-Learning

This repository conceptual answers to some of the common algorithms related to RL. The algorithms include greedy, epsilon greedy, UCB, REINFORCE. 
These topics were covered as a part of COMP0089-Reinforcement Learning module undertaken at UCL. 
These also contain implementation of q learning and actor-critic
